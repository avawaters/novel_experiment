64,508,sarcastic,If she doesn't know about Margaret's dog issues then Julia might think she's being sarcastic and means that really he's adorable. But if she knows she's scared of them then she'd realize she's being sincere.,0,a,4a,R,R,,,R

67,530,sincere,"As they are partners, I'd expect that Jane knows how happy Catherine is to be going to the gym, even if she doesn't agree with it.

67,531,sincere,"Once again, as they are close, it seems like Anastasia would probably be nice about it. If Jack never realized he'd mixed up the salt and sugar, he'd think his cake actually came out ok and that Anastasia enjoyed it (at least enough to be kind about it). ",1,a,3a,R,R,,,R
67,532,sincere,"Julia might be offended by the response, but it would be a strange thing to say with sarcastic intent.",1,b,4b,O,O,,,O

89,711,sincere,There seems to be no bad feeling between the former couple and the response is probably quite sincere.,1,a,7a,,S,I,,S
89,712,sincere,May was probaby not feeling so positive about the trip. Her response to the question was not totally honest but she did not want to provide personal information.,1,b,8b,,S,S,,S
90,713,sincere,"I think Olivia's replies was a genuine compliment. I don't seem to find any form of sarcasm in her response. Alice might not like the hairstyle, but it might look good on her still. ",2,a,1a,,S,D,,S
90,714,sincere,Jane would read Catherine's message as trying to explain that she feels perfectly well enough to gym and she doesn't need to worry about her,2,b,2b,,O,I,,I
90,715,sincere,"I think Anastasia recognizes Jack does not bake, but she appreciates his effort.",2,b,3b,,S,S,,S
90,716,sarcastic,"Margaret respond was sarcastic because of her experience with bulldogs. She probably is telling Julia that no matter how cute your puppy is, I hate dogs!!!",2,c,4c,,S,S,,S
90,717,sarcastic,Lols...that was obviously a sarcastic remark as Phillip didn't like the jacket. He showed that when he scoffs after seeing the jacket during the interview.,2,a,5a,,S,S,,S
90,718,sincere,I think Spencer genuinely mean what he said about Spencer in the letter as he enjoys his company. Children always fight and makeup.,2,b,6b,,S,S,,S

91,721,sincere,"Although she may dislike it and not mean what she is saying, that is not what sarcasm is. The text is not different from the reply you would get from someone being sincere, and there is no way for Olivia to know without more context that she is not being genuine.",1,b,1b,,R,O,,R

91,724,sarcastic,"This is somewhat difficult to determine, as it would depend on Julia having knowledge of Margaret's phobia to understand it is genuine.

91,726,sincere,"This is very difficult to determine, but probably on balance even if he had witnessed a fight between them, David would assume Jeremy was being genuine, and it was a one off. You would probably need more obvious or additional tonal evidence in the rest of what someone had written, to assume/infer they are being sarcastic. ",1,a,6a,,R,O,,R
91,727,sincere,"This is finely balanced, but as with the previous answer, while you might consider the possibility they are being sarcastic, without additional writing in the same tone around it, you would not assume on balance that this is sarcasm.",1,a,7a,,R,O,,R
91,728,sincere,"Nothing about it was nice implies sarcasm. Her friend might think she is holding something back or not being fully truthful, but you would not think of this as sarcasm.",1,b,8b,,D,D,,D

92,730,sincere,"Gesture and facial expression are not in the words, so Jane is more likely to take the words at face value and believe what Catherine has written.",0,a,2a,,R,D,,R

96,768,sincere,Simple answer to a simple question.,1,b,8b,,O,D,,O
97,769,sincere,Both being best friends Olivia would not do anything to make Alice feel insecure about herself. Olivia has gotten this new haircut because she is following Alice's lead unknowing what she really feels inside. So Olivia would take the reply as sincere.,0,c,1c,,R,R,,R

97,772,sarcastic,"This is a hard one to choose. Julia's friends think that her dog is cute, so already she has the mind set that people like her dog. For Margaret to respond with an exclamation sentence, makes it seem more sarcastic than sincere to Julia.",0,a,4a,,R,D,,D
97,773,sincere,For Eric to wear that jacket to an interview means to values it deeply. For someone to make a judgement on it he would have an automatic bias and immediately think of the comment as flattering and nice.,0,b,5b,,R,R,,R

97,775,sincere,If they Ken knew that their relationship ended with a dramatic fight then Ken would think that Ana would have nothing good to say about James. However her response was in contrast.

98,779,sincere,Jack made an honest mistake while trying his best and would be unable to interpret the text as sarcasm.,2,b,3b,,R,R,,R
98,780,sincere,Julia (the new coworker) and Margaret are unfamiliar; Julia may doubt due to the dog being a puppy but would err on Margaret being sincere. If it where one of Julia's friends it may be readily read as sarcasm.,2,c,4c,,R,I,,R

98,782,sarcastic,David has only seen them arguing.,2,b,6b,,R,R,,R

99,785,sincere,because they have been friends for so long Alice is happy to boost Olivia with the compliment.,2,a,1a,,S,I,,S
99,786,sincere,"Catherine is in full recovery and feeling great, this reply does not sound sarcastic to me.",2,b,2b,,S,S,,S
99,787,sarcastic,Confusing salt with sugar gives the answer aren't you so sweet as sarcastic remark not sincere.,2,b,3b,,D,O,,D
99,788,sincere,Margaret has a clear fear of dogs and is sincere in her response to Julia.,2,c,4c,,S,S,,S
99,789,sincere,I believe Eric would find the reply sincere as he doesn't know Phillip enough to gauge his sarcasm,2,a,5a,,R,R,,R
99,790,sarcastic,This is how kids/teens behave and give banter at every opportunity in order to break the ice with others they do not know very well.,2,b,6b,,O,I,,O
99,791,sarcastic,"Nothing says to me that Ana is anything but sincere, however, Ken would know this since he hasn't spoken with Ana since the breakup.",2,c,7c,,R,O,,R
