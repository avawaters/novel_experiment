This achievement is incredibly meaningful to Catherine, who has been suffering from a back injury for a long time. This is her first month back in the gym in a while, and she was worried about how much strength she had lost. She experienced some initial soreness from her first workout in the first and second weeks of her return, but going into the third week, she was feeling pretty strong and content. These endorphins pushed her to hit a PR in back squat, an exercise particularly demanding on the back. She felt like she could go heavier, but decided to keep it safe for her first month back. The adrenaline from getting back into the gym and hitting a PR has made her feel optimistic and excited about her fitness journey. Catherine's partner Jane knows how Catherine has been suffering from a back injury and believes it might be too early for Catherine to be returning to the gym. Jane sends a text to Catherine. 'How'd the gym go? Is everything okay?' it reads. Catherine responds, 'I'm feeling so pumped up today I feel like I could lift a cow.'",
