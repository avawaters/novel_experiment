   "scenario": "Catherine just got back from the gym after hitting a PR (personal record) in back squat. Having suffered from a back injury, this means so much to Catherine. This is her first month back in a while, and she was worried about how much strength she had lost. She experienced some initial soreness from her first workout in the first and second weeks of her return, but now, into the third week, she was feeling pretty strong and content. These endorphins pushed her to hit a PR of 25lbs in back squat, an exercise particularly demanding on the back. She felt like she could go heavier, but decided to keep it safe for her first week back. The adrenaline from getting back into the gym and hitting a PR has made her feel optimistic and excited about her fitness journey. Later, she receives a text message and sees how it is from her partner, Jane. 'How'd the gym go?' it reads. Catherine responds, 'I'm feeling so pumped up I feel like I could lift a cow.'",
